## üé§ Presentation Script (Short, Sharp, Impressive)

> ‚ÄúHello!  
> I‚Äôm excited to present the **Contact Management Web App** I built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks or backends.  
> 
> The app allows users to **add, search, edit, delete, import, and export** contacts, with real-time validation for email and phone numbers.  
> 
> To make it modern and useful:
> - I added **dark/light mode** for better accessibility.
> - Enabled **CSV import/export**, simulating real-world data operations.
> - Built it as a **Progressive Web App**, so it‚Äôs installable and works offline.
> 
> I focused on clean UI, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.
> 
> Overall, this project reflects both front-end skills and product thinking ‚Äî turning a simple concept into something production-ready.  
> 
> I‚Äôd be happy to demo it or walk through the code!‚Äù
